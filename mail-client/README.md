# Mail Client

:construction: Work In Progress :construction:

Enable `mail` command, because it'll support "log shipping" and alerts.

I need to look into this with more attention, but I believe I'll need to configure something like [GNU Mail Utils and perhaps Postfix](https://www.binarytides.com/linux-mail-command-examples/). Watch out for spam filters.
