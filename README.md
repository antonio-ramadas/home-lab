# Home Lab

I have always been a fan of sharing knowledge. I've seen other people and companies doing it and I noticed the positive impact it has. This project attempts to do the same.

I'm building/maintaining a home setup to improve my lifestyle and learn more along the way. Every customization I make is here (except for some that may reveal either too personal information or security-sensitive data). Otherwise, I try to be as open as possible.

This projected is organized by sections. Each one is isolated from the others, but they play nice together. None is complete, but some have not been implemented and are on the backlog. All they detail how to implement the topic it is about.

Only one section is mandatory and should be done first. [Setup](setup) shows the steps to empower the Raspberry Pi to be usable remotely.

This guide focuses on devices I've got available. Currently it is just Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS. However, this is not a restriction.

## Working

What is already working (alphabetical order):

- Bluetooth Player
- DNS
- iOS (missing AirPlay)
- Media Player

## Backlog

Already did some investigation, but haven't implemented yet (alphabetical order):

- Backup
- Containerization
- Desktop Gateway
- Finances
- iOS (AirPlay)
- Mail Client
- Observability
- Reverse Proxy
- Smart Home

## To discover

- Orchestration (I expect to have more devices)
- My GitHub Stars

## Hardware

What I currently have:

- One 500GB HDD from a PlayStation 3
- One Raspberry Pi Model 3B with casing, fan and 16GB SD card
