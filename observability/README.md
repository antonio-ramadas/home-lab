# Observability

:construction: Work In Progress :construction:

I'm looking for a web interface which can show dashboards and logs.

What should be implemented (incomplete list):

- Alerts about banned attempts. Remember IPs in UDP requests can be easily forged, while not completely possible with TCP as it requires 3 requests to communicate.

Tools:

- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
